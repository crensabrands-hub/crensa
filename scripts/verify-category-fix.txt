CATEGORY FILTERING FIX VERIFICATION
====================================

BEFORE THE FIX:
---------------
❌ SearchFilters fetched from: /api/home/categories (doesn't exist)
❌ Category mapping was incorrect:
   - Frontend sent: "entertainment", "education", etc.
   - API expected: "Dance", "Comedy", etc. (wrong categories)
   - Database had: "Art & Design", "Education", etc.
❌ Result: No videos found for any category

AFTER THE FIX:
--------------
✅ SearchFilters fetches from: /api/categories (correct endpoint)
✅ Category mapping is correct:
   - Frontend sends: "art-design", "education", "entertainment", etc.
   - API maps to: "Art & Design", "Education", "Entertainment", etc.
   - Database has: "Art & Design", "Education", "Entertainment", etc.
✅ Result: Videos are correctly filtered by category

CATEGORY MAPPINGS:
------------------
Slug (Frontend)     →  Name (Database)
-------------------    ------------------
art-design          →  Art & Design
education           →  Education
entertainment       →  Entertainment
technology          →  Technology
lifestyle           →  Lifestyle
music               →  Music
gaming              →  Gaming
fitness-health      →  Fitness & Health
business            →  Business
comedy              →  Comedy

HOW TO TEST:
------------
1. Run: npm run dev
2. Sign in to the app
3. Go to: http://localhost:3000/discover
4. Click on any category pill (e.g., "Education", "Entertainment")
5. Videos should now appear for that category
6. Open browser console to see logs:
   - "Filtering by category: education -> Education"
   - "Discover API - Query results: { totalCount: X, ... }"

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

✅ Category pills load correctly (not showing "Loading...")
✅ Clicking a category shows videos (not "No videos found")
✅ Console logs show correct category mapping
✅ Video count updates when switching categories
✅ "All Categories" button shows all videos
